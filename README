Hello.
This GNU screen version has X-server 'clipboard' integration via xsel interface.
Also there are some vim-friendly keybindings added.

INSTALL
=======

Tio make it work one have to:


1. Install xsel from my repo (the one with --zeroflush option)
2. Install GNU screen from this repo.

Now you can use screen's visual mode to select some text and than paste it in your browser.

HOW DOES IT WORK
==================

No, I didn't add any X-protocol code into screen. I just added popen() call wich
starts xsel in daemon mode to handle user selections. See commit history for
details.

BUGS
====

Sorry, but there are some bugs (screen code is tricky for me to work with)

- Sometimes screen selects additional garbage text 
- Sometimes screen hangs
- Screen will definetly hang if you sleect large text block (more than 1.5
  screen of text)


Anyway, thank you for your interest and happy hacking!

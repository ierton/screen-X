Hello.
This GNU screen version has X-server 'clipboard' integration via xsel interface.


INSTALL
=======

Tio make it work one have to:


1. Install xsel from my repo (the one with --zeroflush option)
2. Install GNU screen from this repo.

Now you can use screen's visual mode to select some text and than paste it in your browser.

BUGS
====

Sorry, but there are some bugs (screen code is tricky for me to work with)

- Sometimes screen selects additional garbage text 
- Sometimes screen hangs
- Screen will definetly hang when you sleect large text block (more than one
  screen of text)


Anyway, thank you for your interest and happy hacking!
